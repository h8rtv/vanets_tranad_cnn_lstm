# VANETs TranAD + CNN LSTM
This repository contains all the source code used in our paper "Intrusion detection in vehicular networks using machine learning". It is a fork of the repository of the paper "TranAD: Deep Transformer Networks for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series Data", and it was modified so that it could be applied to the VeReMi dataset and it could also run CNN-LSTM, the other model we compared TranAD to in the context of VANETs.
